        <p> Like moving, switching help desks can be a real pain. But it’s also a chance to improve your support team’s processes, get rid of clutter, and create new habits that make your life easier. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <p> I recently spoke to Knowledge Bird’s Aprill Allen and data migration specialist Ashley Milne from Import2 about the challenges and opportunities of migrating help desk data. If you’re considering switching help desks, their tips will help you prepare and give you the best chance of a smooth data transition. </p>
        <h2>What help desk data should you migrate?</h2>
        <p>Your conversation history with your customers is incredibly valuable. It represents not only the topics and issues a customer has raised with you, but often the personal connections they have made with your team members.</p>
        <p>Migrating your help desk history allows for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy access to the history of your interactions with your customers</li>
          <li>Continuity of care — seeing who they have talked to and when</li>
          <li>One tool to work in (as opposed to keeping the old system for historical records)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally speaking, moving as much data as possible to your new help desk will give your team and your customers a smoother ride through the transition period.</p>
        <h2>New help desk, new opportunities</h2>
        <p>Your new help desk may have capabilities that you didn’t have before. Milne sees a data migration as opening up new options:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote class="large">
        “You don’t have to put your help desk data back in the same place!”
      </blockquote>
      <div class="second">
        <p>Before you begin planning your migration, consult with the support or sales team from your new help desk to learn what your options are. Particularly if you’ve had more than a year or two on your current help desk, revisiting your tagging strategy and workflows through the lens of your current needs will help you make significant performance improvements.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h2>Factors impacting a help desk migration</h2>
        <strong>What data is your current tool able to export?</strong>
        <p>Every system is different, so you need to know what you can move before you spend too much time on it.</p>
        <strong>Is there a well-developed API to use on both ends?</strong>
        <p>With solid, well-featured and documented API access (see Help Scout’s API docs for example), you have even more options for data migration.</p>
        <strong>Can you get help desk developer support?</strong>
        <p>Every migration is different, so being able to ask for assistance as part of your migration may be vital if things get complicated. (You might consider a specialist migration service who will likely have experience with your current and future help desk tools.)</p>
